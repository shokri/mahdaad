I focused on completing Tasks 1 and 5 with custom implementations and ensured that Task 1 was properly covered by unit tests to validate reactivity and localStorage synchronization.

For Task 3 and Task 4, due to the need for more intricate test setups, I relied on working code patterns to demonstrate the intended behavior quickly and clearly.

Task 2 was skipped as it required more time for setting up proper state structure and test coverage, which was beyond the available time window.
